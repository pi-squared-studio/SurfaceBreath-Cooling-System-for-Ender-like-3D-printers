# SurfaceBreath Cooling System (for Ender-like 3D-printers)
_Simple thing to increase quality of yours 3D prints_

## Features

**Description:**	This device is an additional cooler for the printed part to improve product quality. The main purpose is to ensure uniform cooling of the upper layer of the part, against the formation of overhangs bending upwards.	

**Designed for:**	Voxelab Aquila C2

**Compabtility:**	All Creality Ender-3 clones with 235 mm bed width.

**Mount:**		at backside of X-axis 	


## Overview

In my practice, I have encountered the problem of breaking off a part of a part (or even the entire part) from the bed during the printing process. When I began to study this problem, it turned out that the curved overhangs rising up from the temperature were to blame for everything. This was due to the fact that the part was still heated from the table, and although its temperature was lower than the temperature of the softened plastic, the additional heat radiated from the hotend was enough for this process to take place. Even the cooling of the standard fan, baked at 100%, was not enough to stop this process, which could start a few centimeters away from the cooling stream.
The second problem, after I adjusted all the temperature and speedy settings, and the parts no longer came off the bed, was that slightly protruding overhangs could spoil the appearance of the surfaces. This became especially noticeable when using silk PLA in art projects. Defects occurred on both external and internal overhangs. It could either be a non-glossy, furrowed surface, or random "warts" appeared on it.
It was decided to develop an additional cooling system to the existing one in order to remove such defects. This is not a replacement for the standard one, but only serves to optimize the temperature regime at the printing surface. In other words, it "freezes" the topmost layer from accidental additional heating. SurfaceBreath has no additional effect on the main fan flow.
SurfaceBreath creates a very weak laminar flow along the entire print surface, similar to light breathing, and displaces stagnant thermal zones that are not affected by the cooling of the main fan.
Now your printer will not face the problem of the extruder nozzle colliding with the printed part, and its possible separation from the bed!

SurfaceBreath was tested by me for PLA plastics and showed amazing results. According to my estimates, the adhesion of the part itself to the bed has even improved.
There are no definite results with other plastics yet, as I have always had a great experience with PETG.
ABS-like plastics, yes, the small parts like they've started to look a little smoother. I have not tried with large parts made of this plastic, since I do not have a thermal case.
