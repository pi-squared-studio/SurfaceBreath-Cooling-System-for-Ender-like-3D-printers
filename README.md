# SurfaceBreath Cooling System (for Ender-like 3D-printers)
_Simple thing to increase quality of yours 3D prints_

## Features

**Description:**	This device is an additional cooler for the printed part to improve product quality. The main purpose is to ensure uniform cooling of the upper layer of the part, against the formation of overhangs bending upwards.	

**Designed for:**	Voxelab Aquila C2

**Compabtility:**	All Creality Ender-3 clones with 235 mm bed width.

**Mount:**		at backside of X-axis 	


## Overview

In my practice, I have encountered the problem of breaking off a part of a part (or even the entire part) from the bed during the printing process. When I began to study this problem, it turned out that the curved overhangs rising up from the temperature were to blame for everything. This was due to the fact that the part was still heated from the table, and although its temperature was lower than the temperature of the softened plastic, the additional heat radiated from the hotend was enough for this process to take place. Even the cooling of the standard fan, baked at 100%, was not enough to stop this process, which could start a few centimeters away from the cooling stream.
